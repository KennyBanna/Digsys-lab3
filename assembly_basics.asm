Lab 3 digsys

1.1 Write an assembly program that load the values 3 and 4 into r16 an r17
add the result to r17

ldi r16, 3
ldi r17, 4
add r17, r16

1.2 Assume a user have entered their age in a program. The value is stored in register r16. Write a
program such that if the age is above or equal to 18, you store the value 1 in register r24, otherwise
you store the value 2 in r24. After the check, you shall just enter an infinite loop.
