Home Assignment 1.1
How many clock cycles are needed if a delay of 0.1 s is desired with a clock frequency of 16
MHz?

	0.1 = 1/16000000 * x
	x = 1600 000
	1600000 cycles (duh)


Home Assignment 1.2
How many bits do we need to count to the value above?

	log2(16000000) = 20.6
	21

Home Assignment 1.3
How many registers do we need for the delay of 0.1 s?

	3 x 8 = 24 so three?
	
	
Home Assignment 1.4
Write a snippet of assembly code that delays the program for roughly 0.1 s. Remember that
the jump instructions also take time to execute.

	jump instructions. 
	2 cycles if executed, 
	1 if "ignored"?
	

Home Assignment 1.5
How do you turn on LED 2 on port B in assembly? Remember to set the direction to an output.
Refer to Appendix A for instructions


Home assignment 2.2
If you allocate an array of bytes on the stack, and the stack pointer after allocation is 0x40E0,
what is the address of the value at index 3?

0x40E0 : index 0
0x40E1 : index 1
0x40E2 : index 2
0x40E3 : index 3 (Answer)

Lab Question 2.2
What happens if we do not return the allocated memory in the subroutine?

We will overwrite the data on the stack and lost it

Lab Question 2.3
Do we need to store the values in the allocated array? What happens if we just store the values
randomly on the stack?

- If we store them randomly we won't know where we find them
