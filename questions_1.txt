Home Assignment 1.1
How many clock cycles are needed if a delay of 0.1 s is desired with a clock frequency of 16
MHz?

	0.1 = 1/16000000 * x
	x = 1600 000
	1600000 cycles (duh)


Home Assignment 1.2
How many bits do we need to count to the value above?

	log2(16000000) = 20.6
	21

Home Assignment 1.3
How many registers do we need for the delay of 0.1 s?

	3 x 8 = 24 so three?
	
	
Home Assignment 1.4
Write a snippet of assembly code that delays the program for roughly 0.1 s. Remember that
the jump instructions also take time to execute.

	jump instructions. 
	2 cycles if executed, 
	1 if "ignored"?
